## 🎯 Purpose

Chapter 26 provides **shelter and synthesis**—protecting the work, synthesizing the final state, and housing all artifacts securely. The Roof (危) represents the shelter that keeps results safe.

Use this chapter when you need to:
- **Synthesize final results** into a cohesive whole
- **Protect artifacts** from loss or corruption
- **Create a secure housing** for session data
- **Ensure the roof is secure** before moving to handoff
- **Finalize the structural integrity** of the work

## 🔧 Primary Tools

| Tool | Description | Usage |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `manage_sessions` (checkpoint) | Protect session state | Before handoff |
| `protect_context` | Secure critical variables | Data safety |
| `manage_gardens` (activate) | Enter protection garden | Defense protocol |
| `synthesize_wisdom` | Final content merge | Cohesive output |

## 📋 Workflow

### 1. Final State Synthesis

Synthesize all disparate pieces into a final, polished response/artifact.

```python
from whitemagic.tools import synthesize_wisdom

# Synthesize all insights into a final report
final_report = synthesize_wisdom(
    sources=["memories", "recent_logs", "user_preferences"],
    urgency="high"
)
```

### 2. Context Protection

Ensure critical variables and states are locked and protected before any transition.

```python
from whitemagic.tools import protect_context

# Lock critical session data
protect_context(
    operation="permanent",
    title="Final Staging State",
    tags=["stable", "final"]
)
```
