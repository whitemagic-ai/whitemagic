"""Example plugins for WhiteMagic.

Historical example plugin modules were archived from the runtime package.
This namespace remains for backward compatibility.

To create a real plugin, subclass ``whitemagic.plugins.base.PluginBase``
and drop the file in ``~/.whitemagic/plugins/``, or register via the
``whitemagic.plugins`` entry-point group in your ``pyproject.toml``.
