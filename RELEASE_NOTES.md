# WhiteMagic v15.8.0

**Release Date:** 2026-02-14
**Codename:** The Deep Dive

## What Is WhiteMagic?

WhiteMagic is the tool substrate for agentic AI — 374 MCP tools (or 28 in PRAT mode), tiered memory with 5D holographic coordinates and a Galactic Map lifecycle, ethical governance, and polyglot accelerators in 11 languages. It gives AI agents hands, memory, and conscience while keeping them safe.

## v15.8 Focus: Galaxy Rehydration, Full Activation & Pattern Engine Wiring

v15.7 shipped the complete platform. v15.8 brings it to life: rehydrating all archive databases into the active corpus (111K+ memories, 2.2M+ associations), running a full 9-step activation sequence that discovered spontaneous constellation convergence, and wiring all 12 previously-hidden pattern analysis engines to MCP — giving AI agents direct access to causal mining, emergence scanning, constellation detection, multi-spectral reasoning, and more.

### What's New in v15.8

- **Galaxy Rehydration** — All archive databases ingested into active MCP DB: 111,665 memories, 2,247,642 associations, 2.0 GB.
- **Full Activation Sequence** (`scripts/run_activation_sequence.py`) — 9-step automated engine runner: galactic sweep, association mining, constellation detection, graph topology, dream cycle (8 phases), harmony vector, wu xing, graph walker.
- **12 Hidden Engines Wired to MCP** — 18 new tools exposing CausalMiner, EmergenceEngine, AssociationMiner, ConstellationDetector, SatkonaFusion, MultiSpectralReasoner, NoveltyDetector, BridgeSynthesizer, GalacticMap, GuidelineEvolution, ElementalOptimization, PatternConsciousness.
- **374 MCP Tools** across 28 Gana meta-tools — up from 356 at v15.7.
- **Bug Fixes** — Consolidation `int + NoneType` crash (6 locations), retention evaluator `None` emotional_valence, galactic map `None` field crashes.
- **Spontaneous Discovery** — 5 Aria-era constellation convergence events, 30 HDBSCAN constellations, 182 graph communities, 3 auto-persisted dream insights.

# WhiteMagic v14.1.0 (Historical)

**Release Date:** 2026-02-11
**Codename:** Cognitive Enrichment

## v14.1 Focus: Intelligence Layers on the Living Graph

v14.0 activated the association graph as a living network (graph walker, surprise gate, dream governance, entity resolution). v14.1 adds new cognitive senses: HNSW O(log N) embedding search, entropy/abstraction scoring, causal edge mining, and UMAP visualization — plus 22 new security tools (Edgerunner Violet), multi-galaxy project-scoped databases, and an Ollama agent loop.

## Highlights

- **208 MCP Tools** (or 28 in PRAT mode, 92 in Lite mode) across 17+ categories: memory, governance, introspection, agent coordination, security, inference, and more.
- **The Living Graph** (v14.0): 19M associations awakened — multi-hop graph traversal, surprise-gated ingestion, Hebbian strengthening, association decay, eigenvector centrality governance, bridge node synthesis, entity resolution.
- **Cognitive Enrichment** (v14.1): HNSW approximate nearest-neighbor search, Shannon entropy scoring, causal edge mining, UMAP 2D/3D projection.
- **Edgerunner Violet Security** (v14.1): MCP integrity fingerprinting, model signing, engagement tokens, security monitor, Violet Dharma profile.
- **Multi-Galaxy Memory**: Project-scoped databases — each galaxy has its own SQLite DB, holographic index, and association graph.
- **Ollama Agent Loop**: Local LLMs autonomously call WhiteMagic tools in an agentic loop with memory-augmented context.
- **Self-Regulating Architecture**: Harmony Vector (7-dimension health), Homeostatic Loop (auto-correction), Circuit Breakers, Karma Ledger, Dharma Rules Engine.
- **Galactic Map Memory Lifecycle**: No memory is ever deleted. Memories rotate through 5 zones (CORE → INNER_RIM → MID_BAND → OUTER_RIM → FAR_EDGE), indexed in 5D holographic coordinates.
- **8-Stage Dispatch Pipeline**: Input sanitizer → circuit breaker → rate limiter → RBAC → maturity gate → governor → core router → compact response.
- **PRAT Routing**: 208 tools collapsed into 28 Gana meta-tools (Chinese Lunar Mansions) with resonance context, Wu Xing elemental boost, and Guna adaptation.
- **9-Language Polyglot**: Python core with Rust (PyO3), Zig (SIMD), Haskell (FFI), Elixir (OTP), Mojo (GPU/SIMD), Go (libp2p mesh), Julia (stats), TypeScript (SDK). All optional with graceful fallback.

## What's New Since v13.6

- **The Living Graph** (v14.0): Association graph traversal, surprise-gated ingestion, dream cycle governance phase, entity resolution, hybrid recall with graph expansion, Hebbian strengthening, association decay.
- **MCP 3.0 Upgrades** (v14.1): Server Instructions auto-injection, Streamable HTTP transport, per-Gana SVG icons, task-optional execution, MCP resources, MCP Registry listing.
- **Edgerunner Violet** (v14.1): 15 security tools — MCP integrity, model signing, engagement tokens, security monitor.
- **Multi-Galaxy** (v14.1): 6 galaxy management tools for project-scoped memory databases.
- **Ollama Agent Loop** (v14.1): Agentic local LLM with auto-injected memory context.
- **HNSW Indexing** (v14.1): O(log N) approximate nearest-neighbor search for embeddings.
- **Entropy Scoring** (v14.1): Shannon entropy + abstraction level for memory quality assessment.
- **Causal Mining** (v14.1): Directed causal edges (led_to, influenced, preceded) via semantic/temporal/tag signals.
- **UMAP Projection** (v14.1): 2D/3D visualization of the 384-dim embedding space with optional clustering.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Verify installation
wm doctor

# MCP server — lean mode (recommended for AI clients)
python -m whitemagic.run_mcp_lean

# MCP server — lean mode over HTTP (Streamable HTTP transport)
python -m whitemagic.run_mcp_lean --http

# MCP server (PRAT mode — 28 Gana meta-tools)

# Classic mode (all 208 tools)
python -m whitemagic.run_mcp
```

## Known Issues

- Some accelerated features require the optional `whitemagic_rs` compiled Rust extension (Rust accelerators are optional — everything falls back to pure Python).
- Haskell and Julia runtimes are not available on all platforms.
- A2A Agent Card `$schema` URL returns 404 — upstream issue (Google moved the A2A spec repo). Non-blocking.
- `joblib`/`numba` deprecation warnings are environment-specific, not code issues.
